# Smart-Gate-Embedded-project
A project for Embedded systems course by Eid Maghareez, Talal Aqaileh, Noor Qudah

The Smart Water Tap, utilizes the PIC16F877A microcontroller. This system allows for precision control over two separate water tanks, one for hot water and one for cold water, providing the user with the ability to easily switch between the two through the convenience of voice commands. Additionally, the Smart Water Tap is equipped with a safety mechanism that prevents water pump from running if the water tank is almost empty. The system has sensors that continuously monitor the water level and if it's almost empty, an interrupt turns on and the water pumps will automatically turn off. This ensures that the user will not run out of water unexpectedly. The Smart Water Tap is designed to make daily tasks more convenient and efficient, with the added bonus of water conservation. With its user-friendly interface and advanced technology, the Smart Water Tap is the perfect solution for any household or commercial setting.

The main components of this project include two high-performance water pumps connected through a relay circuit to the PIC, and a Bluetooth module that receives voice commands from a smart phone application. 
The first water pump is specifically designated for the pumping of hot water, while the second pump is responsible for pumping cold water. Additionally, this project incorporates two advanced water level sensors to monitor the water tanks and ensure an adequate supply of water is maintained for optimal system operation.
